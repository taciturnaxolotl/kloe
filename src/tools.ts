/**
 * The tool registry. Each entry is an AI SDK `tool` with an input schema and an
 * `execute`; `streamText` runs the agentic loop (call → execute → feed back),
 * and the actor persists each tool-call/tool-result as a durable event that the
 * UI renders as a timeline step.
 *
 * Tools are only offered when their backing capability is configured (e.g.
 * `web_search` appears only when a search provider is set), so a deployment
 * without them sends no `tools` at all.
 *
 * First slice: read-only, side-effect-free tools executed in-process. The
 * durable-loop guarantee (persist a result before the model sees it, so a job
 * reclaim doesn't re-run a side-effecting tool) and the sandbox executor come
 * with dangerous tools later — pure tools are safe to re-run on reclaim.
